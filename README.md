a fork from https://github.com/Adoni/word2vec_pytorch

I will note this repository and update the use of PyTorch in a new version. 

Why I do? On one hand, I want to learn word2vec, Also, I would like to learn the use of PyTorch, Cause that I had only used  the TensorFlow in the past few Years. While I am looking for a job, I need to show others about my ability in PyTorch. So, I begin my journey of learning PyTorch and NLP-related models.

If you found this forked repository, and also the same goals like me, hoping that the repository will help you a little :)

So, Let's Start!

Word2vec-PyTorch
====

> Warning: this repo is poseted two years ago and it's not compatible with the current pytorch (v1.0.0). I will update it as soon as possible

This is the implementation of word2vec based on PyTorch.

Run it with

    python word2vec.py zhihu.txt word_embedding.txt


I write a [blog](https://adoni.github.io/2017/11/08/word2vec-pytorch/) about the word2vec based on PyTorch.
